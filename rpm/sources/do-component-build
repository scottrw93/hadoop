# The Yarn UI and the yarn applications catalog both require a version of node.js which does not work with centos6
# I've removed -Pyarn-ui, and added the below -pl exclusion in order to get around this incompatibility.
# If we end up needing yarn-ui as part of a yarn upgrade, we'll need to investigate building this for centos8 or some
# other more tactical workaround like pinning the node.js to an older version. I tried that with -Dnodejs.version, but that
# failed for other dependencies that expected a particular node version, etc. So a deeper investigation will be necessary.
